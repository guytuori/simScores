Version: 0.1
Authors@R: person("Kevin", "Ferris", email = "kevin.ferris10@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides methods to take raw baseball statistics , calculate
    MLEs, then build, run, and deploy a shiny app which identifies players
    with similar statistics.  It is designed for a user with no R background,
    and mostly uses csv files and shiny apps to interact with users.  However,
    users with some background in R should be able to access and modify the
    apps and data.  See the vignettes for examples.
